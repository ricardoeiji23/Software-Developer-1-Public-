The test plan should show:
    The data to be used (Input)
    The reason for the test (Reason)
    The expected result (Expected)
    The actual result (Actual)

        - The test plan covers a variety of scenarios to ensure the code handles different input cases corretly


Types of test:
    - Valid input Testing
    - Invalid input Testing
    - Negative input Testing
    - Program termination Testing
    - Mixed input testing (3, abc, 5, -2)
    - Edge case testing (Minimun and maximum valid input)
    - Empty input testing 
    - Repetition testing (2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3...)

Test for the valid inputs

    Input: 
        1
        4
        7

    Reason:
        Check if the indicated numbers are linked to the color in the list

    Expected:
        Read
        Green
        Violet

    Actual:
        Read
        Green
        Violet


Test for invalid inputs:
    Input:
        abc
        0
        8

    Reason:
        To see if it'll print the error message and only the range of number works

    Expected:
        "Plase, input a integer number" (Since the first Try needs to be a integer number)
        "Invalid input, please chose between 1 and 7 (Or a negative to end)" (It's a integer number, but in the range)
        "Invalid input, please chose between 1 and 7 (Or a negative to end)" (It's a integer number, but in the range)

Testing negative input
    input:
        -5

    Reason: 
        It should end the program since if the input is lower than 0, it'll break the infinite loop

    Expected:
        "Program terminated"

    Actual:
        "Program terminated"
